# NutriVision
Hello everyone, we're the developer team behind NutriVision, a web-based health app designed to educate users on potential harmful ingredients including nutrition facts and common allergens using computer vision, image processing, and optical character recognition.

# Background
Recently, we learned about macronutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, sugars, and sodium in our biology lecture, and its impact on our health. This piqued our interest in nutrition and introduce company tricks that disguise harmful processed ingredients such as MSG as monosodium glutamate on a food label or preservative ingredients like disodium glycerophosphate. Even companies disguise common allergens with small texts, causing those with visual impairments to miss key words in the "may contain" and "contains" sections of food labels. In addition, many common allergens in US-born humans are linked to other "ghost allergens", or in other words, allergens commonly linked with other allergens. For example, a common ghost allergen paired with peanuts are sesames and walnuts, and sometimes, humans with peanut allergens may get allergic reactions to foods they have not tested "allergic" for, yet still receive an allergic reaction. In addition to allergens, we also intend to highlight users' intake of excessive amounts of various macronutrients according to the scanned nutrition label. For future installments, we intend to consider health issues such as diabetes and suggest warnings based on a human's dietary restrictions and health restrictions.
